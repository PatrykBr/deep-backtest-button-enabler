# Deep Backtest Button Enabler

This extension enables the deep backtest button on TradingView, even when the settings dialog is open. It continuously monitors the page for changes and ensures the button remains enabled. It also intercepts the click event to temporarily hide an interfering dialog and simulate the click.

## Features

- **Button Enabling:** Automatically re-enables the "Generate report" button if TradingView disables it.
- **Dynamic DOM Monitoring:** Uses a MutationObserver with a debouncing mechanism to detect DOM changes and maintain the button state.
- **Smart Click Interception:** Temporarily hides the settings dialog and simulates a click on the button.
- **Randomized Delays:** Applies random delays during the process to mimic natural user behavior.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works on both Chrome and Firefox.
